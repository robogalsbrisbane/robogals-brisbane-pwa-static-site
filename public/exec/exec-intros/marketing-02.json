    "whyStudyAnswer": "I chose chemical engineering because it is a degree that allows me to combine my passion for science (especially chemistry) and maths to problem-solve some of the world's biggest challenge in sustainability by creating unique and innovative solution. ",
    "dreamJobAnswer": "",
    "whyRobogalsAnswer": "I joined Robogals because I am very inspired by the emphasis on diversity and inclusion in STEM. A stereotypical belief is that as a first year student, there is not much you can do to promote STEM education. However, after a conversation with the other super friendly executives at Robogals, I realise I can start making a difference in STEM education for young women and not in a million year would I let that opportunity slip through my finger. ",
    "appliedStemAnswer": "I have so many... One of the most recent ones is this amazing biodegradable packaging product that are made from nothing but biological materials and is even edible. The biggest advantage of this material is that animals can consume the plastic without suffering health implication. And this wonderful application really tells me when it comes to STEM, sky is the limit ",
    "funFactsAnswer": "This is probably not a fun fact, but I grew up with no engineers in my family and the only distant relationship I have with engineering is that my dad did car engineering in university but he has never practiced engineering ever since. So I am very thrilled that I will be the pioneer in engineering in my family. "
